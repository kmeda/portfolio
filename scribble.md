I enrolled in Freecodecamp bootcamp last year with very little programming knowledge. I am now comfortable and confident about programming in general and the many fields of software engineering that can be applied to.

Having built both frontend and backend projects in Javascript I have gained Fullstack experience with MERN. React with redux has been a lot of fun to work with and Node for the backend. I also look forward to learning functional reactive programming with RxJS.
